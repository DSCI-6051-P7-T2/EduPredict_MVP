# EduPredict_MVP : Data-Driven Decision Making for Enrollment Trends and Educational Policy Analysis in Higher Education

## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a comprehensive data-driven framework to analyze and forecast enrollment trends in higher education within a non-specific country context. The 
primary focus is on creating data science tools and methodologies that support decisionmaking for educational institutions and policymakers. The project will involve data 
collection, integration, and analysis, and will utilize machine learning models to predict future enrollment trends. The outcomes will be presented through interactive dashboards to enable stakeholders to explore different scenarios and understand the potential impacts on higher education enrollment.


Inspired by international studies that project enrollment trends based on key demographic and socio-economic factors, this project will develop a scalable and adaptable framework that can be applied to various countries and regions.s.
