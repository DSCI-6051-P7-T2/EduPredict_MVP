## Objective
The EduPredict Tool aims to forecast international student enrollment trends using machine learning (ML) techniques. Higher education institutions face volatile enrollment trends, necessitating accurate forecasting tools for strategic planning.

---

## Scope
- Develop an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with scenario-based forecasts for decision-makers in higher education.
- Implement models using **Python**, **Power BI**, and **scikit-learn** for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- Enhance predictions with insights derived from historical enrollment data.

---

## CRISP-DM Methodology
### **Phase 1: Business Understanding**
- **Problem**: Institutions need actionable forecasts to address enrollment volatility.
- **Solution**: Provide scenario-based forecasts tailored for strategic planning.

### **Phase 2: Data Understanding**
- **Data Source**: Open Doors dataset, capturing international student enrollment trends.
- **Analysis**: Trends, correlations, and anomalies were identified, enabling improved feature engineering.
- **Challenges**: Addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and incomplete records through rigorous data cleaning.

### **Phase 3: Data Preparation**
- **Steps**: Data cleaning, integration, and formatting to standardize features.
- **Challenges**: Managing data inconsistencies and ensuring readiness for analysis.

### **Phase 4: Modeling**
- Models Used:
  - **ARIMA**: For time series analysis.
  - **Linear Regression**: For feature-based predictions.
- **Training Process**:
  - Dataset split: 80% for training, 20% for testing.
  - Feature standardization to maintain consistency.
- **Results**:
  - ARIMA model performed best, effectively capturing time series patterns for enrollment forecasting.

### **Phase 5: Evaluation**
- Evaluated model accuracy and dashboard effectiveness to support institutional decision-making.
